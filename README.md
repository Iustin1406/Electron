# Electronic Circuit Editor with WinBGIm Library

This project is an electronic circuit editor developed in C++ using the WinBGIm library. Its purpose is to empower users to create, modify, save, and delete electronic circuits based on their preferences. Here are the key features and functionalities:

## Circuit Creation:
Users can design custom electronic circuits by adding components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and more.
The interface allows users to click on the canvas to place components directly onto the circuit board. This method ensures precise positioning for creating electronic circuits. 
Circuit connections (wires) can be established by drawing lines between components.

## Editing Capabilities:
Once a circuit is created, users can easily edit it. This includes: moving components around the canvas, rotating components to the desired orientation and adjusting component properties.

## Save and Load:
Users can save their circuits to files for future reference or modification.
Loading a saved circuit allows users to continue working on it.

## Deletion and Cleanup:
Users can delete unwanted components or entire circuits.
The project ensures proper cleanup by removing unused wires and optimizing the circuit layout.
